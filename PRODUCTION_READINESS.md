# PRODUCTION READINESS AUDIT

**Role:** Autonomous CTO  
**Date:** 2026-09-30  
**Overall Readiness Verdict:** **STAGING READY / PRODUCTION PREREQUISITES IDENTIFIED**

## 1. What Works in Production-Style Workloads

- **Deterministic State Machines:** Agent lifecycles, workflow executions, and approvals transition via strictly typed enums and database locks.
- **Fail-Safe Fallbacks:** Four-tier intelligence provider routing ensures that requests degrade gracefully without dropping organizational tasks.
- **Observability:** Centralized audit logs with HMAC-SHA256 integrity signatures and structured telemetry records.
- **Data Integrity:** UUID primary keys, declarative foreign key relationships with explicit cascading rules, and soft delete constraints.

## 2. Production Prerequisites & Gaps

| Pillar | Current State | Production Requirement | Action / Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Database Engine** | Default SQLite file database (`nexora.db`) | Managed PostgreSQL 15+ cluster with PgBouncer connection pooling | Add config support & migration instructions |
| **Worker Queue** | In-process asynchronous task dispatch | Distributed task queue (Celery, ARQ, or BullMQ with Redis) for long workflows | Document & plan background worker runner |
| **Secrets Storage** | Environment variables & `.env` file | Enterprise Vault (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or GCP Secret Manager) | Encrypted runtime key loading |
| **Live AI API Keys** | Mock/simulation adapters active | Direct HTTPS API integration to OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and Ollama | Implemented in this hardening pass |
| **Health Probes** | Basic `/health` endpoint | Deep readiness & liveness probes (DB ping, Redis ping, Provider ping) | Documented and configured |

## 3. Deployment Checklist

1. [ ] Configure `DATABASE_URL` pointing to high-availability PostgreSQL.
2. [ ] Set `SECRET_KEY` with a cryptographically strong 256-bit entropy value.
3. [ ] Configure live provider API keys: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
4. [ ] Enable rate-limiting middleware on public auth endpoints.
5. [ ] Ensure TLS 1.3 termination at reverse proxy / load balancer.
