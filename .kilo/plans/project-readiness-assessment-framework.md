## 13. Self-Critique: Gaps, Errors & Improvements

### 13.1 Structural Gaps

| # | Gap | Severity | Impact | Status |
|---|-----|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **No industry/context adaptation** — Framework assumes generic software project; no guidance for hardware, regulated, ML, or infrastructure projects | HIGH | Misapplied criteria lead to false GO/NO-GO | OPEN |
| 2 | **No organizational maturity model** — Doesn't account for startup vs enterprise vs government context | MEDIUM | Over/under-engineering for context | OPEN |
| 3 | **Missing Agile/SAFe integration** — No mapping to Definition of Ready (DoR) at team level or PI planning gates | MEDIUM | Disconnect from delivery methodology | OPEN |
| 4 | **No portfolio/program view** — Single-project focus ignores resource contention across portfolio | HIGH | False confidence when shared resources overcommitted | OPEN |
| 5 | **No quantitative scoring rubric** — "Score 1-5" is subjective without anchor definitions | HIGH | Inter-rater reliability < 0.6 expected | **FIXED** (added §8 anchors) |

### 13.2 Content Errors & Flaws

| # | Error | Location | Correction | Status |
|---|-------|----------|------------|--------|
| 1 | **Weighted total minimum (3.6) < Stakeholder minimum (4.0)** — Mathematically impossible to pass if Stakeholder=4.0 but others=3.5 (0.2×3.5+0.2×4.0+0.2×3.5+0.15×3.5+0.15×3.5+0.1×3.0 = 3.575 < 3.6) | §8 Dimension Weighting | Fix: Lower Stakeholder min to 3.5, adjust weights, set weighted min to 3.5 | **FIXED** |
| 2 | **§6.1 "Buffer Allocated" references feeding buffers but framework has no CCPM methodology** | §6.1 (now §7.1) | Add CCPM reference or remove feeding buffer requirement | OPEN |
| 3 | **§5.1 "≥15 risks" arbitrary threshold** — No justification for number | §5.1 | Replace with "risks covering all categories with ≥2 per category" | OPEN |
| 4 | **§4.1 "15-25% contingency" contradicts §4.2 "Phased Funding" gates** | §4.1, §4.2 | Clarify contingency is for execution phase only | OPEN |
| 5 | **§7 Gate 14 "DR plan tested" but §3.3 only requires "RPO/RTO defined and tested"** | §3.3, §7 | Align: Gate 14 should reference §3.3 evidence | **FIXED** (Gate 16 now references §3.3) |
| 6 | **§11 "Technical Debt Ratio < 5%" has no measurement method defined** | §11 | Add: "Measured via SonarQube/CodeClimate ratio" | OPEN |
| 7 | **§9 Phase 2 "Evidence Collection (Week -1)" unrealistic for complex projects** | §9 | Make duration configurable: "Week -2 to Week 0" | OPEN |

### 13.3 Missing Critical Dimensions

| # | Missing Dimension | Why Critical | Status |
|---|-------------------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | **Data Readiness** — Data quality, lineage, governance, migration readiness | #1 cause of ML/analytics project failure | **FIXED** (added §6) |

### 13.4 Missing Diagnostic Depth (unchanged)

| Area | What's Missing |
|------|----------------|
| **Technical Feasibility** | No spike/POC validation criteria; no architectural fitness function; no chaos engineering readiness |
| **Risk Assessment** | No risk appetite statement; no risk aggregation methodology; no Monte Carlo schedule risk |
| **Budget** | No cash flow projection; no foreign exchange risk; no capital vs opex split |
| **Timeline** | No critical chain analysis; no resource histogram visualization; no learning curve modeling |
| **Stakeholders** | No RACI maturity assessment; no communication plan quality criteria; no conflict resolution mechanism |
| **Resources** | No skills gap quantification; no contractor vs FTE cost model; no knowledge retention risk |

### 13.5 Usability & Implementation Flaws (unchanged)

| # | Flaw | Recommendation |
|---|------|----------------|
| 1 | **No tooling support** — Purely manual spreadsheet/process | Provide: Excel template, Jira/Confluence automation, API for CI/CD integration |
| 2 | **No calibration guidance** — How to align scores across assessors | Add: Calibration workshop script, anchor examples for each 1-5 score |
| 3 | **No executive summary template** — Decision makers need 1-page view | Add: 1-page dashboard with traffic lights per dimension |
| 4 | **No version control for assessment** — Framework evolves, assessments don't | Add: Assessment versioning, baseline comparison, audit trail |
| 5 | **No integration with project management tools** — Jira, Azure DevOps, Asana, MS Project | Add: Webhook/API specs for automatic evidence collection |
| 6 | **No retrospective mechanism** — Post-project: how accurate was readiness prediction? | Add: Post-mortem template comparing predicted vs actual gaps |
