# /catch-arch-rot — Architectural Drift & Decay Prevention

Inspect, detect, and arrest architecture decay at the pull request and commit boundary.

## What is Architecture Rot?
- Leaking mock data into live operational paths.
- Untyped `any` or loose dictionaries in core business logic.
- Domain boundary crossing (e.g. web directly accessing DB or bypassing API client layer).
- Missing state completeness (omitted `Loading`, `Error`, `Empty`, or `Permission` branches in UI).
- Circular imports and non-isolated domain dependencies.
- Discarding zero-filler protocol in agent outputs.

## Audit Checklist & Verification Commands

### 1. Static Type & Contract Integrity
- **Frontend Type Safety**:
  ```bash
  cd apps/web && npx tsc --noEmit
  ```
  *Rule*: 0 untyped `any` in business logic; strict interface alignment with API schemas.

- **Backend Type Safety & Linting**:
  ```bash
  uv run --directory apps/api ruff check .
  ```

- **Rust High-Performance Kernels**:
  ```bash
  cd packages/engine-rs && cargo check
  ```

### 2. Boundary Isolation Checks
- **No Direct DB Access in Presentation**: All frontend routes MUST consume `lib/api/*.ts` client modules.
- **Strict Tenant & Company Isolation**: Every API endpoint handling enterprise state MUST accept and verify `company_id`.
- **Model Output Untrusted**: Model outputs must be validated against schemas (`PromptSanitizer`, `ModelOutputBoundary`).

### 3. Automated Rot Scanner Script
Run the automated architectural rot scanner:
```bash
python3 .agents/skills/catch-arch-rot/scripts/audit_rot.py
```
