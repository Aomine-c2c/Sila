# NEXORA Frontend UI Roadmap

> **Status:** Planning Phase
> **Goal:** Build a production-grade Next.js frontend for NEXORA that replaces all 6 static HTML prototypes
> **Approach:** Phase-based delivery — core functionality first, then enhancements, then platform extensions

---

## Phase 0: Foundation (Week 1–2)

**Goal:** Scaffold the monorepo, shared packages, and foundational infrastructure.

### Tasks

| # | Task | Details |
|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | Initialize `apps/web/` | Create Next.js 14+ project with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| 0.2 | Set up `packages/` monorepo | npm/yarn workspaces: `types`, `api-client`, `ui`, `design-tokens` |
| 0.3 | Generate types from OpenAPI | Use `openapi-typescript` to generate `packages/types/` from backend's `/api/openapi.json` |
| 0.4 | Generate API client | Use `orval` or `openapi-typescript` to generate typed hooks in `packages/api-client/` |
| 0.5 | Configure shared Tailwind | Tailwind config in `packages/ui/`, extended with design tokens |
| 0.6 | Set up testing stack | Vitest (unit), React Testing Library (component), Playwright (e2e) |
| 0.7 | CI/CD pipeline | GitHub Actions: lint → test → build → type-check |

### Deliverables

- `apps/web/` with dev server running at `http://localhost:3000`
- `packages/types/` with all backend API types generated
- `packages/api-client/` with typed API functions
- Basic auth flow: login page → JWT → HttpOnly cookie

### Acceptance Criteria

- `npm run dev` starts the dev server
- Login page renders and can POST to `/api/v1/auth/login`
- JWT is stored in HttpOnly cookie
- Protected routes redirect to login when no cookie
- Type generation completes without errors

## Phase 1: Core MVP — Agent Inspector (Week 3–4)

**Goal:** Replace `agent_profile.html` with a fully-typed Next.js page. This is the highest-priority UI surface — it represents the core "employee profile" concept.

### Tasks

| # | Task | API Endpoints |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Layout component | Shared header + sidebar navigation |
| 1.2 | Auth provider & middleware | JWT cookie → `/auth/me` on load |
| 1.3 | Company context selector | `/companies/me` to list user's companies |
| 1.4 | Agent list page | `GET /companies/{id}/agents` |
| 1.5 | Agent profile page | `GET /companies/{id}/agents/{id}/profile` |
| 1.6 | Status badge component | Map `AgentStatus` enum to color + icon |
| 1.7 | Tab system | Audits / Memories / Communications tabs |
| 1.8 | Status transition modal | `POST /companies/{id}/agents/{id}/transition` |
| 1.9 | Audit timeline | `GET /companies/{id}/agents/{id}/audits` |
| 1.10 | Memory list | `GET /companies/{id}/agents/{id}/memories` |
| 1.11 | Transition validation | Enforce `VALID_TRANSITIONS` rules in frontend |
| 1.12 | Loading skeletons | Agent profile hero + metric rows |
| 1.13 | Error boundaries | 404 for invalid agent ID |

### Design Deliverables

- Agent profile page matches `agent_profile.html` visual design
- Status tags use unified color system (see DESIGN_SYSTEM.md §5.2)
- Responsive: sidebar collapses to hamburger on mobile

### Acceptance Criteria

- Agent list shows all agents with live status badges
- Clicking an agent navigates to `/agents/[id]`
- Profile page shows: avatar, status, autonomy, role/department, instructions, intelligence config, tools, resource usage, performance metrics, audits timeline, memories
- Status transition dropdown enforces valid transitions only
- All 7 `AgentStatus` values are correctly color-coded

---

## Phase 2: Governance & Control Center (Week 4–5)

| 2.12 | Resource request evaluator | `POST /companies/{id}/resources/requests` |
| 2.13 | Cost/spend charts | Use Recharts: bar chart (spend by provider), progress bars (budget utilization) |

### Acceptance Criteria

- Constitution page shows amendment history with diff view
- Action evaluator returns APPROVE/DENY/REDUCE/DEFER/QUEUE with reason
- Approvals table shows pending + historical with decision buttons
- Resource control center matches `resource_control_center.html` design (stats grid + pools table + evaluator)
- Intelligence dashboard matches `intelligence_dashboard.html` design

## Success Metrics

By the end of Phase 3 (replacing all 6 static HTML pages), we will measure:

1. **Functional parity**: All 6 prototype UIs have Next.js equivalents
2. **Type safety**: Zero TypeScript errors against generated backend types
3. **Performance**: Lighthouse score ≥ 90 on desktop, ≥ 85 on mobile
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA pass rate ≥ 95%
5. **Developer experience**: `npm run dev` starts in < 3s, hot reload in < 500ms
6. **Bundle size**: Initial JS bundle < 250KB (excluding fonts)
7. **API coverage**: 100% of endpoints used by UI are type-safe

---

## Next Steps

1. **Approve this roadmap** — confirms scope and priorities
2. **Create `apps/web/` and `packages/`** — start Phase 0
3. **Set up OpenAPI type generation** — ensures all subsequent work is type-safe from day 1
