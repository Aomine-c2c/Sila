"""
Council Deliberation Engine.

Coordinates the full organizational deliberation lifecycle:
1. PROPOSAL: Candidate proposals assembled from context and initial ideas.
2. INDEPENDENT REVIEW: Each council member (using their configured perspective and model provider)
   independently generates:
   - proposal
   - evidence
   - risks
   - assumptions
   - confidence score (0.0 - 1.0)
   - objections
3. OBJECTIONS: Explicit extraction and compilation of conflicting architectural/operational constraints.
4. DISCUSSION: Multi-round debate where participants respond to objections.
5. SYNTHESIS: Designated Synthesis Agent evaluates all arguments and synthesizes a balanced decision proposal.
   Crucial principle: Disagreement does NOT imply failure or error — disagreements are recorded as permanent
   organizational knowledge!
6. DECISION: Final decision ratification.
7. RECORD: Automatically persists into the company's decision repository and organizational memory.
