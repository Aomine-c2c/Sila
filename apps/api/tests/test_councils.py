"""
Comprehensive Pytest Suite for NEXORA Agent Councils & Organizational Deliberation.

Verifies:
1. Assembly of Agent Councils (Permanent & Temporary) with specialized participant perspectives:
   - Architecture Council: CTO, Architect, Backend Engineer, Security Engineer, QA Engineer.
   - Assigning heterogeneous model providers (Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, OpenAI).
2. Execution of Full Deliberation Pipeline:
   - PROPOSAL: Problem framing & initial architectural hypothesis
   - INDEPENDENT REVIEW: Each participant independently evaluates:
     * proposal
     * evidence
     * risks
     * assumptions
     * confidence score
     * objections
   - OBJECTIONS: Explicit extraction and compilation of domain-specific constraints
   - DISCUSSION: Multi-round debate addressing objections
   - SYNTHESIS: Synthesis agent produces a balanced decision proposal
   - DISSENT RECORDING: Preserving disagreements as permanent organizational knowledge
     (Disagreement does not mean one model is wrong; both perspectives are preserved).
3. Decision Ratification & Storage:
   - DECISION: Official ratification
   - RECORD: Stored in Decision domain and Organizational Memory domain.
